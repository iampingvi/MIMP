# MIMP (Minimal Interface Music Player)

![Screenshot](Images/Screenshot.png)

## The Story Behind MIMP

As a DJ, I frequently download large music packs from various DJ pools like Hypeddit and others. One common challenge is the need to efficiently preview numerous tracks to find the right ones for your sets. This process can be time-consuming, especially when you need to quickly identify drops and breakdowns in tracks.

That's why I created MIMP - a minimalistic music player specifically designed for DJs. It focuses on essential features that matter most to DJs, without any unnecessary complexity. The waveform visualization allows you to quickly jump to drops or breakdowns, saving valuable time during track selection and preparation.

- **Format Support**: Compatible with all major DJ-friendly formats:
  - MP3
  - AIFF

- **Native Performance**: Built specifically for Apple Silicon Macs (compatible with Intel Macs)
- **Auto-Updates**: Built-in updater to keep your app current
- **Compact Mode**: Streamlined view for minimal screen space usage
